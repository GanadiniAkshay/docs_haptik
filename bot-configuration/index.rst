Configuring and Deploying your Bot
==================================

This section contains information about the organizational hierarchy the Haptik bot builder tool uses which allows users to create complex bots and deploy them easily across multiple channels. This information is vital to understanding initial bot setup, so we recommend you read the pages in this section before proceeding with your bot building. 

This section also includes information about how to deploy your bot.  

However, if you want to go straight to the documentation covering the first steps of building your bot, jump to the `Bot Builder 
<http://www.python.org/>`_ section.
