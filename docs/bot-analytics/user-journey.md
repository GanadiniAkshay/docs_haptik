title: User Journey
---

This section in our analytics tool helps you analyze how users move in the chat flow. How you'd want to see funnel performance in a website, you'd want to see the *User Journey* in chatbot conversations. 

Assuming you've selected a particular business/channel and custom date range, you'd see a view, listing all nodes. 

## Nodes list

On this nodes list, you see all start or non-start nodes here.

For more details on a node, you can click the *Select metric* filter to list with - 

1. Incoming traffic 
2. Bot Breaks
3. Drop Offs 
4. Outgoing traffic

The node with the highest no. (metric value) will have the max bar length and consider this as 100%. And every other node bar length is relative to this value.

Above this nodes list, you have the colored legends, sort and metric filter drop-downs.

       Outgoing traffic value counts users who go through to another node from the selected node. 
       
       Dropping Users are the ones who dropped out of the conversation from the selected node.

## Detailed Node view

Select/Click on a specific node to view the node level details. The white section that you get for a selected node is divided into 3 sections:

![Nodes view](/assets/user-journey-node-detailed-view.png)

1. Incoming Traffic: Node-wise incoming users and *Start of Conversation* users give the count of users reaching the selected node 
2. Center section: Here, check a Node’s metrics totalled i.e. Incoming & Outgoing users’ count volume, Drop-offs and Bot Breaks
3. Outgoing Traffic: Node-wise Outgoing users and *End of Conversation* users give the count of users leaving the selected node 

Example - Say a node called “C” was selected; we get the traffic from Nodes A, B to C on the *Incoming Traffic* section. And the traffic from C to other nodes will be displayed on the *Outgoing Traffic* section.

## On-hover Node details

*Incoming Nodes* hover gives count and percent traffic from overall incoming traffic on a node.
