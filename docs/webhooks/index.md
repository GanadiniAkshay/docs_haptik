title: What is a webhook
---

Web hooks provide a functionality where by a provider application can notify a client-side application when a new event has occurred on provider's server.

Webhooks are "user-defined http/s callbacks", that allow two applications to communicate automatically.

A key difference between an API end point and a webhook:

In APIs, the client-side application calls the server-side application for some sort of information. Whereas, in case of web hooks it is the server-side that calls the client-side application, when a particular server-side event occurs.
