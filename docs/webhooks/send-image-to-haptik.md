The Image upload API allows you to upload user images via a `POST` request to the Haptik Platform. The URL for image uploads is generated on the Haptik Platform Dashboard.

### URL

`https://staging-messenger.haptikapi.com/v1.0/log_file_from_user/`

### Headers

```
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
client-id: <CLIENT_ID>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=MultipartBoundry
```

- Authorization - The Authorization header of each HTTP request should be “Bearer” followed by your token which will be provided by Haptik
- client-id - The client id for your account which will be provided by Haptik
- Content-Type - multipart/form-data; boundary=MultipartBoundry

### Response

A successful request will return a `200` status code with a JSON response object with a unique message id and other metadata about the messages.

```json
