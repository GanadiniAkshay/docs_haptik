### Keep in mind your audience's background, goal & mood

- Is the reader a prospective user, a new user, or an experienced user? What is the goal of the reader? To complete a task? To research a topic? Is the reader in the middle of a task? Are they in a hurry? Could they be frustrated?

- Your Article Type (User Wants) ⇒ Best Practise (Context), Cheat Sheet (References), Getting Started (Overview), Pathfinder (Orientation), Tutorial (Guidance), Warning (Assurance) \

### Prime the reader with a brief outline of an article's focus in an introductory para

Include "This article contains… " styled section with certain questions. Read previous & next articles. Ensure that the articles have a common flow

### Use ONLY 2nd person future tense

"First, you'll need to install FooBar v7. Then, when you've frozzled the Whizang, you can start working on the Doodad"

### Keep the paragraphs, headlines & sentences short.

Don't use conjunctions (such as "and" or "or") 3-5 sentences per paragraph

### Provide context by using Dashboard GIFs & Screenshots

Including Screenshots of Empty States

### Include examples which will make it easier to understand complex tasks

Do not use idioms. Do not use fluff words like "very", "pretty", "good" \

### Capitalise the first letter of Haptik features. Italicize navigation & button labels

"First, add a Partner and then proceed to add a Business"
"Click on _Save & Next_"

### Highlight common mistakes & share tips

Think of all places where someone might make a mistake and highlight those areas with a box to ensure common mistakes are highlighted upfront

### Add relevant links in text & further reading

If you think something should be a part of two documents, include it in BOTH \

### Peer review your updates

Specifically ask for, account for and block some time for your documentation. If possible, write documentation _while_ you're coding. Make it a part of code review

### Converting GoogleDoc content to .md (markdown)

Paste your content on a markdown editor. You can easily find good editors online. For example, Dillinger can be used to export your markdown files.

If you're familiar with markdown, another way is directly editing content on the github editor. Alternatively, you can download Typhora and work offline as well.
