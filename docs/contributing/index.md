We use **Docusaurus** for hosting all public documentation. We have 4 instances of docusaurus hosted across 4 different repositories. The homepage links to all the different sections of the documentation and the common header and footer aid in the same.

You can currently access the new documentation portal here https://docs.haptik.ai

The documentation is essentially split into 2 parts

- **Platform Documentation**
  This is hosted under the **docs_haptik** repository. There is **no versioning** for this set of documentation. The **homepage** is also hosted and served from here.

- **SDK Documentation (Android/iOS/Web)**
  The documentation for the SDKs are hosted under their respective source code repositories. Each SDK gets their **own docusaurus instance** with **independent** **versioning** in accordance with the release process based on Git tags.

**NOTE:** Both sets of documentation follow their own release process. More on that in the next section.
