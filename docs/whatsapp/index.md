## Overview
WhatsApp helps more than 1 billion people connect and share with the people they care about. WhatsApp is a simple, secure, and reliable way for businesses to reach their customers all over the world. 

# Features
The WhatsApp Business API Client supports a subset of the features provided by the WhatsApp applications you already know from Android, iOS, Web and other platforms including end-to-end encryption. The difference is that this application can be deployed on a server, providing a local API that allows you to programmatically send and receive messages and integrate this workflow with your own systems (CRMs, customer care, etc.).

Please note that if you use anything other than the official WhatsApp Business API or other official WhatsApp tools, Whatsapp reserves the right to limit or remove your access to WhatsApp as this violates their policies.

WhatsApp Business API provides the following features:

* **Industry Information** - People can now easily identify your business by its category or industry and find out more information (i.e., hours of operation, website, location, description).
* **Send and Receive** - Enable two-way high value conversations with customers.
* **Message Templates** - Create message formats that are needed for sending notifications to users.
