title: Getting User Opt-Ins
---

## What is it?
A user must first consent to receive messages in WhatsApp by opting into them via a third-party channel. It must meet the following guidelines:

1) **Active Opt-in**: Opt-in must be triggerred by the user.
   
      * Must Opt-in with a visual element shown next to WhatsApp name and logo.
      * User should have control over what number is used through explicit action.
2) **Clear Messaging**: A user should know what type(s) of messaging they                            will receive on WhatsApp.
      
3) **Third-Party Channel**: The consent should be obtained on a third-party channel. This can be any channel the business currently uses to communicate with its customers. It can be through website, app, email, SMS etc. 

> **NOTE:** The consent must be obtained outside WhatsApp. The use of click-to-chat links is not permitted for obtained opt-in.


## How does WhatsApp track Opt-ins?
Currently, WhatsApp doesn't actively track opt-ins. Opt-in is a privacy policy and this is measured indirectly by looking at the number of users blocking the business.

If users start blocking the business WhatsApp number then the health status of the number will go down and after a limit the number will be blocked.

WhatsApp will not provide information about individual users blocking the number but the overall health of the number can be checked in the `Facebook Business Manager` tool.
