title: Business Setup

Before we start whatsapp integration we need to get the business and phone number approved. 
The Steps Involved are:

**Apply for access** - Whatsapp Business APIs are only available to approved businesses. Businesses can apply for approval by filling a questionnaire and submit to us and we will get the business approval as a whatsapp partner.

**Procure a number** - After getting approval, the next step is to connect a number. The number should be a fresh number with no prior WhatsApp account associated to it. 

The number can be a mobile number, landline number or even an IVR number. The only restriction is that it should also be capable of either receiving a SMS or a Call for OTP verification.
