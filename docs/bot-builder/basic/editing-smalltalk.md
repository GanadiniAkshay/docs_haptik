title: Editing Smalltalk
---

Small Talk is used to provide responses to casual conversation. This feature can greatly improve the user experience by making the bots more chatty and covering common questions that may not relate to your bot's intents. 

        This section adds ability to discover all intents added to the global copy of Smalltalk.

## What is Smalltalk?

Other than the stories you create for your particular bot flows, `Smalltalk` will be a default story on every bot. 

        Bot builders should be able to ‘edit bot says’ and ‘add new bot says’

Smalltalk has 4 personas. These personas should be selected basis your bot audience. That is as per your target user, you'd want the smalltalk responses to be casual or formal. This means teh smalltalk content we created has been created keeping in mind different categories of bots. **You choose the smalltalk persona while creating a bot.** 

1. Default
2. Casual
3. Funny
4. Formal

## Actions on Smalltalk?

As a bot builder, you would be able to disable Smalltalk story as a whole. Or as a bot builder, you can - 

1. disable/enable intents within the smalltalk module

2. add/edit bot says within any smalltalk intent

The idea here is to give bot builder full power over the Smalltalk story (module).
