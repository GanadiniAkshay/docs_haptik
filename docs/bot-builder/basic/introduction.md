Welcome to **Mogambo**, Haptik's bot builder tool! Once you've mastered *Mogambo*, you'll be able to build bots with minimal coding. To get you started, we've put together this documentation that will guide you through the process of building a bot on *Mogambo*.

    Tip: A bot is a program that communicates with you, commonly using a chat or voice interface.

**How is Mogambo used?**
On *Mogambo*, you can create a bot i.e. formulate different conversation flows. Instead of creating bots on your own, *Mogambo* gives you a framework and components to build the bot without much effort. 

**How does the Bot building process work?** 
Creating the conversation flow your bots will use might seem straightforward, but there are a few things bot builders do to increase how engaged users feel as they interact with bots - 

1. You add the expected user intents (*user says*) and corresponding bot responses (*bot says*)
2. And then, you configure ways a bot is supposed to interpret user's inputs. *Integrations* and *Settings* are components within *Mogambo* to configure your bot
3. Once you create the bot, you test it before deploying across any platform. 

We've detailed out the process of creating bots step-by-step, all the way from chatflow design to bot deployment. Read up the various articles from the left-hand navigation. 

    **Tool Tips**: For those of you who want to jump right in, we've built tooltips directly into Mogambo. 
    By hovering over the tooltips, which are indicated by the small "i" or "?" in circles, you'll be able 
    to view brief descriptions of how to use most of the major components in Mogambo.
