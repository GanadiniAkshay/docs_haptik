## Moving between chats

On the *My Chats* section in **Live agent** tool, a user could press function buttons on keyboard to switch between the multiple chats.  

Example: Say, a chat agent has 3 chat tabs, the agent can use F1, F2 and F3 to switch between chat tabs. While the agent is in conversation with a user on F2; the agent can press F1 or F3 to switch from the F2 tab. Here, F1 always corresponds to the first chat tab on the left. And F2 next, then F3 corresponds to the third chat tab on the right.

## Using keyboard to move across canned responses / composer

Using up/down arrows keys, agents will be able to navigate canned responses. Agent can move from composer to the canned responses list by using the up arrow and back to composer via using the down arrow key on keyboard. As an agent moves from composer to the canned responses list, agent should be able to navigate with up/down arrow keys on keyboard to move between canned responses. 

> Note: When agent moves from canned response 1 to canned response 2, we  highlight the response on which the agent is on.

On pressing enter for a particular canned response suggestion, we copy the suggestion in composer and close the opened suggestions list. Now, it's on agent to click send icon on composer to send the response to the user. Since agents might want to slightly edit the canned response suggestion before sending it to the end user, we put it in composer and not send this canned response suggestion directly to end chatting user on enter key press.
