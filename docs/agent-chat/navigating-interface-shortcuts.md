## Moving between chats

On the *My Chats* section in **Live agent** tool, an user could press function buttons on keyboard to switch between the multiple chats.  

Example: Say, a chat agent has 3 tabs - F1, F2 and F3. While the agent is in conversation with an user on F2; the agent can press F1 or F3 to switch from the F2 tab.

## Using keyboard to move across canned responses / composer

Using arrows keys, agents will be able to navigate canned responses. Agent can move from composer to the canned responses list and back to composer via the arrow keys on keyboard. As an agent moves from composer to the suggestions list, agent should be able to navigate with arrow keys on keyboard to move between canned responses. 

> Note: When agent moves from canned response 1 to canned response 2, we  highlight the response on which the agent is on.

On pressing enter for a particular canned response suggestion, we copy the suggestion in composer and close the opened suggestions list. Now, it's on agent to click send to send the response to the user. Since agents might want to slightly edit the canned response suggestion before sending it to the end user, we put it in composer and not send this suggestion directly to end chatting user on enter key press.
