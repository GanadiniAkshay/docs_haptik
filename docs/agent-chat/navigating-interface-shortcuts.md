On the *My Chats* section in **Live agent** tool, an user could press function buttons on keyboard to switch between the multiple chats.  

Example: Say, a chat agent has 3 tabs - F1, F2 and F3. While the agent is in conversation with an user on F2; the agent can press F1 or F3 to switch from the F2 tab.
