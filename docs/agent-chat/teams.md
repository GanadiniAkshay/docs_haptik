This article will help you learn about the team feature in Agent Chat.

A team is a group of agents who are trained to handle user queries related to a specific topic.

A business is eligible to assign chats to a team based on the specific configuration in the business manager. Following are the possible configurations:

1. A Business can be Completely Bot Assisted (No Team routing)
2. A Business can be Bot + Human Assisted.
3. A Business can be Completely Human Assisted.

### Example

In the above example, Airtel is a partner. There are three teams, which lie under Airtel as a Partner. Teams are not directly associated with a business. They are associated with nodes in the chatflow for a particular bot.

Note: Every Business has a default team in case no team is detected.

Note: For no bot condition, the default team is the only team a partner can have)

# Chat routing to a team

There are three ways in which a chat can be assigned to a team

1. Routing from a bot’s node
2. Manual Assignment
3. Team routing from Business (When a business has no bots)
