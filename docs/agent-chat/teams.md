_Last Updated: 15th February 2019 by Vaibhav Verma_

This article will help you learn about the team feature in Agent Chat.

A team is a group of agents who are trained to handle user queries related to a specific topic. 


# Involvement of a team in a Chat Service


A business is eligible to assign chats to a team based on the specific configuration in the business manager. Following are the possible configurations:



1. A Business can be Completely Bot Assisted (No Team routing)
2. A Business can be Bot + Human Assisted.
3. A Business can be Completely Human Assisted.


### Example



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Teams-Documentation1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

In the above example, Airtel is a partner. There are three teams, which lie under Airtel as a Partner. Teams are not directly associated with a business. They are associated with nodes in the chatflow for a particular bot.

Note: Every Business has a default team in case no team is detected.

Note: For no bot condition, the default team is the only team a partner can have)
