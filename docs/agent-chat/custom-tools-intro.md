## What Are Custom Tools

When a client wishes to use some of their internal tools within our agent dashboard for ease of data access, the can do so.

The below example shows how we use our tools internally.

The RHS section is where all the tools, as defined by our clients will appear.

When a user selects a tool, the url associated to that tool will be loaded within that iframe.
Example: Click on reminders, the below tool is loaded within the RHS.

The agent can then use the tool as its meant to be, and assist the user in accomplishing his/her task.
