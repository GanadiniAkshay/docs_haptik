title: For Chat Agents

## Introduction

When a Chat agent logs into athena, he can essentially click on the *My Chats* tab i.e. the first option depicted in the left-hand menu bar.

## My Chats

In this tab the chat agent can start taking chats assigned to him/her personally. 

A chat agent can:
  * View his current live chats
  * Exchange messages with the user
  * Send [smart actions](https://docs.haptik.ai/agent-chat/smart-actions)
  * Mark [chat as complete or waiting for user](https://docs.haptik.ai/agent-chat/claiming-and-closing#closing-completing-chats)
  * Assign chat to a person or a team
  * Use [custom tools](https://docs.haptik.ai/agent-chat/adding-custom-tools)
  * Adding [disposition tags](https://docs.haptik.ai/agent-chat/claiming-and-closing#chat-disposition)
  
  Depending on the permissions and features assigned to a Chat agent user, more actions could become accessible. 
  
    Tip: We also have a system to enforce Data level permissioning i.e. an agent user 
    is allowed to view/edit the data for which client can be controlled using this.
