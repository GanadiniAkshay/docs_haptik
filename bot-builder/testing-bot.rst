Testing your Bot
----------------
Bots can be tested in number of ways. You can deploy and connect the bot to any of the Client SDKs - iOS, Android, Web, Facebook.

The easiest way to test your bot is directly on the bot building tool itself. To set this up, define the *Test-Business* on the domain itself. This will be the business where messages will be sent. Make sure your domain/bot is active on this business as well.

Debugging your Bot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On the Bot-Builder tool, you will see a **Log** icon near the messages you sent once the bot has processed the particular messag. Clicking on this icon will provide you details on how the bot is behaving, what nodes were detected, what entities were collected and their value etc. This information is useful to understand why a bot is behaving in a certain way and how to fix the bot to get the desired results
