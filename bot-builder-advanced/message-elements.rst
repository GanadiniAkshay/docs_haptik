Advanced Messaging Elements
---------------------------
Haptik defines a superset of UI elements that are available across multiple platforms. These UI elements are then converted to their platform equivalent if they are not available on that specific platform. Eg. Forms are converted to quick replies on the Facebook platform and collected over free form.
