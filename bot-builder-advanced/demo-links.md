The Demo Page is an easy way to showcase and test a bot you have developed. 

SImply visit the page https://toolassets.haptikapi.com/js-sdk/html/demoqp.html (Make sure to match the security level of HTTP or HTTPs to your server) and input the test credentials to test your bot.

You can also pass the setup value as query parameters to the URL and use a link shortener to generate a predefined demo page.

Eg.https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/tools-cdn/js-sdk/html/demoqp.html?business-id=<insert business id here>&client-id=<insert client id here>&api-key=<insert api key here>&header-text=<insert header text here>

This will load the Demo Page with this variable already prefilled and the input fields hidden
